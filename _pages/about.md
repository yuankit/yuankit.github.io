Hi there!! :wave: :wave: Sim's here, a recent graduate in MEng Mechanical Engineering / Aerospace with University of Southampton. Love solving real world's problem by **(1) conducting research**, **(2) generating innovative design**, **(3) modelling and simulation**, with experience working on R&D and design projects in the field of :sound: **sound & vibration control**, :palm_tree: **biofuel**, biomedical as well as lifestyle product design.

Following my interest in the field of sound & vibration control, my final year group design project and undergraduate thesis had been centred around this field. For my final year group design project, I have worked on a **low noise ducted axial fan rig** for the demonstration of patented low noise technologies, and was in charge of the mechanical aspect of it. Whereas for my undergraduate thesis, I have developed numerical models to study the feasibility of incorporating **Acoustic Black Holes** (lightweight passive vibration control solution) in typical aircraft panels, e.g., :airplane: aircraft fuselage.

Throughout my University years, I had the opportunity to join the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, University of Southampton as a summer intern, designing **lightweight sound insulation solutions** with combinations of **Acoustic Metamaterial and Acoustic Black Holes**. Previously, I was also a research intern in University of Southampton Malaysia Campus, developing a data-driven model to investigate the **global sustainability of bioethanol**.

Feel free to reach out. More than happy to discuss about my projects (or anything else)! :smiley: :thumbsup:
