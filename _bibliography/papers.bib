        abstract = {Plate-type acoustic metamaterials (PAM) consist of a thin baseplate with periodically attached masses. Even though PAM can be very lightweight, their low-frequency sound transmission loss can be substantially higher than the corresponding mass-law due to so-called anti-resonances. This makes PAM particularly interesting for noise control applications that have strict constraints on the mass and size of noise control treatments, such as aeronautical applications. The typically narrow bandwidth of these metamaterials can be broadened, for example, by stacking multiple PAM layers with different anti-resonance frequencies. Further improvement at higher frequencies is possible by filling the air gap between the PAM layers with porous materials. In recent years, the vibroacoustic properties of PAM have been studied extensively, but most previous studies used materials for the manufacturing of PAM that are difficult to recycle (e.g. metals or polymers). In this contribution, first results of a numerical study of the low-frequency sound insulation of a double-PAM panel composed entirely of sustainable materials will be presented. Different possible materials will be assessed in terms of their applicability to the PAM (baseplate and masses) as well as the porous filling, their environmental footprint, and their impact on the sound transmission loss of the panel.}
