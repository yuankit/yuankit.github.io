## Project description
The aim of the project is to design a mechatronic responsive system that respond to environmental stimuli, specifically light intensity (luminosity) and air humidity. For simplicity, only the light intensity-related part will be presented in this post. As inspired by kinetic architecture and sustainable building, an origami-based roof is developed that 'opens up' when the light intensity raises above certain threshold.

Aside from the origami fan, another main feature of the design is the use of an universal joint to transmit the rotational power (from central stepper motor) to translational motions at multiple inclined work planes, such that all three roofs are moved (retract/extend) simultaneously, for energy efficiency and cost saving purposes. This is shown in Figure 1.
