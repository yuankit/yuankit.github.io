## Project description
Malaysia is a nation with plenty of rain throughout the year. The frustration of needing to operate an umbrella when getting in/out of the car  is inevitable. More so for the physically challenged who drives alone. Assembling and disassembling mobility aids require time and space that may not necessarily be available on a rainy day. A roof extension just outside the driver seat came intuitively as the solution to this problem.

An origami inspired, hassle free rain shield is designed to be installed along the door of a vehicle, to create an extended dry zone for both the physically and non physically challenged. Origami Vehicle Rain Solution (OVeRS) is designed for all drivers on a rainy day. For example, the physically challenged who needs to assemble/disassemble mobility aids, and the non physically challenged who would be able to open/retract umbrellas comfortably without getting wet, thanks to the extended dry zone. OVeRS utilises the nature of origami for a compact and rigid design. It removes the necessity of a supporting skeleton that is typically present in the case of an umbrella. The use of origami also removes the need of a complex mechanism, which reduces the needs for maintenance and hence increases its reliability.

OVeRS is mounted along a vehicle door profile to fully cover the space between the door and car body when the door is opened. This is achieved by adhering flexible rubber mounts on the car exterior. A zig zag folded fabric is then attached to the rubber mounts tightly using snap lock pins. The fabric folds tightly upon closing the door to prevent flapping. Besides, the fold design of the fabric does not add additional tension to the opening motion of the vehicle door. A paper like, hydrophobic and waterproof material is used for the fabric, to develop permanent fold crease and repel water. Such design allows the water collected to be squeezed out by the folding motion, when closing the door. The curve profile of the fabric is achieved by implementing a roof tile pattern fold. It is strictly required to design the rain shield with only a single piece of fabric, such that the risk of water leakage through the spaces between the neighbouring fabrics can be eliminated. The zig zag pattern of the fabric also diverts water to flow along the valleys of the fabric, down the curved profile, and away from OVeRS.
