## Project Abstract
Acoustic Black Holes, ABH is a potential lightweight vibration control solution, achieved by introducing geometrical modifications to a structure. Vibration control and being lightweight are one of the most important design requirements in the transportation sector, especially for an aircraft. ABH fits in perfectly in satisfying these demands. However, ABH being a relatively new concept, majority of the studies focus on its application on a flat plate or beam, limiting its horizon of applications. To address this problem, this project is motivated to explore the feasibility of a circular ABH being embedded into an aircraft panel. The aircraft panel is modelled as singly curved, open, thin shell or known as ‘curved plate’ in this project. It is demonstrated mathematically that the maximum attainable ABH radius is limited by the plate radius of curvature which may restricts the ABH effectiveness, especially for highly curved plate.

Analytical model of a curved structure is highly complex and difficult to be developed. Alternatively in this project, finite element method has been utilised to study the dynamic behaviour, particularly estimate the total kinetic energy, of the curved plate in response to ABH integration and compare to that of flat plate, at frequency range corresponding to the low-mid frequency performance of ABH. Similar trends of dynamics have been observed for both plates with ABH embedded. As broadband vibration control solution, significant ABH damping performance on curved plate is demonstrated and is shown to be comparable to that of ABH on flat plate. These could possibly be an indication that current understanding of ABH on flat plate can be qualitatively translated to ABH on curved plate. Parametric studies are also carried out to investigate how ABH radius, truncation thickness, number and position affect the total kinetic energy of the curved plate. For the frequency range of interest, it is suggested that the optimisation of ABH radius should be prioritised first before the optimisation of truncation thickness. It is also demonstrated that at below cut-on frequency, ABH ineffectiveness could be compensated by adjusting the number of ABH and its arrangement on the plate.

In this post, the effect of an ABH being embedded in both flat and curved plate is compared and presented in the form of a poster (previously submitted for University of Southampton Individual Project Poster Day). The parametric studies mentioned above is excluded in this post.
